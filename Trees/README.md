# 🌳 Data Structures & Algorithms – Binary Trees & BST (C++)

This repository contains my implementations of important Binary Tree and 
Binary Search Tree problems in C++.

I am practicing DSA consistently and implementing all problems from scratch 
to strengthen recursion, tree traversal, and BST concepts.
